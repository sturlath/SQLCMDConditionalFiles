# Conditionally get file content into publishing script in VS database project

**The problem**

 I **ONLY** want to get *selected content into the publishing script that gets created when choosing different variables*, **nothing else**! This is a test project to help answer two of my StackOverflow questions.

* [How not to include sql file content when publishing?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42846424/how-not-to-include-sql-file-content-when-publishing)
* [Using variable in sql postdeployment build script?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26178189/using-variable-in-sql-postdeployment-build-script) (*I got this one answered way back but now I have different needs (see the first one) that I need answered*)

**Steps to create**
 1. Get the code
 2. Double click the file **Customer1.publish.xml** 
 3. Click "**Load Variables**" that vill load Customer1 (see images in [How not to include sql file content when publishing?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42846424/how-not-to-include-sql-file-content-when-publishing))
 4. Click "**Generate Script**"
 5. If you find "Customer2 stuff from Customer2.sql" in the generated file **you have not fixed** my problem.
 ```
Print 'This print statement should not be in the publishing script if Customer variable is not customer2'
print 'Customer2 stuff from Customer2.sql'
```

I have tried 3 variations and no one worked. Taka a look at [Script.PostDeployment1.sql](https://github.com/sturlath/SQLCMDConditionalFiles/blob/master/SQLCMDConditionalFiles/Script.PostDeployment1.sql) and see what I have tried.


**Is it even possible?**

 I will probably have to to this in future build scripts (or manually until that gets setup). But until then IÂ´m hoping somebody can just tell me if this is possible or not in the deployment scripts.
